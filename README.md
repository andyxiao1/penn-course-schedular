# Penn Course Schedular
**CIS 197: JavaScript Final Project (Currently in progress)**

**Idea:** Webapp that allows Penn students to type in the courses they want to take and return all possible schedules with those classes

**Technologies:** React, Node/Express

**Current Progress:** Express server connected is mostly complete, but breaks on large cases (ie 100,000+ possible schedules). Planning on only sending 100 schedules per request, and sending more on subsequent requests.
