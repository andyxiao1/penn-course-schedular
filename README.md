# Penn Course Scheduler

**CIS 197: JavaScript Final Project (Currently in progress)**

**Idea:** Webapp that allows Penn students to type in the courses they want to take and return all possible schedules with those classes

**Technologies:** React, Node/Express

**Current Progress:** Express server is finished. It sends a max of 200 schedules. Frontend works and shows possible schedules, but UI for the schedule view needs to be cleaned up

**TODO**
Add pagination for server  
clean up UI  
add back to course search page button  
account for bad inputs  
account for no schedule cases  
customization  
change start and end time of schedule view depending on earliest and latest course times
