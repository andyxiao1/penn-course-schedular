# Penn Course Schedular

**CIS 197: JavaScript Final Project (Currently in progress)**

**Idea:** Webapp that allows Penn students to type in the courses they want to take and return all possible schedules with those classes

**Technologies:** React, Node/Express

**Current Progress:** Express server is complete. In cases of large number of possible schedules, it returns at most 200. Right now it returns schedules as a string for testing. Planning on adding pagination in MS3.
